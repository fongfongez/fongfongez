## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Meng-Feng Li**, a career switcher with 8 years of frontline operations experience — now fully focused on **data engineering**.

🔧 In my previous role, I built an Excel reconciliation tool that:
- ⏱ Reduced daily processing time from 2 hours → 30 minutes  
- ❌ Cut error rate by ~90%  
That’s when I realized how much impact the right tools and automation can make.

### 🚀 What I Do Now

I'm working on end-to-end data pipelines — from scraping and cleaning, to storage and scheduling.  
Here are some tools I work with:

- **Python** for scripting and automation  
- **MySQL** for data storage and queries  
- **Docker** to containerize and scale projects  
- **Airflow** for orchestrating workflows

### 🎯 What Drives Me

I love solving messy, real-world problems with code.  
My goal? **Make systems run smoother, faster, and smarter** — and share what I learn along the way.

Let’s build things that work, and make them better.
